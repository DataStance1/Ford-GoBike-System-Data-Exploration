In this investigation, I wanted to look at the characteristics of the members and the day of the week and time of the day that could be used to determine the duration of a trip by a member.

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area throughout the month of February 2019 and was obtained from https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data. Data consists of info about trips taken by service's members, their types, their age, their gender, stations of starting and ending trips, duration of trips etc.
