# Ford-GoBike-System-Data-Exploration
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area throughout the month of February 2019 and was obtained from https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data. Data consists of info about trips taken by service members, their types, their age, their gender, stations of starting and ending trips, duration of trips etc.
#
In this investigation, I looked at the characteristics of the members, the day of the week and the time of the day that could be used to determine the duration of a trip by a member.
 #
 This project involves two parts: the initial data exploration and the slide preparation. The initial data exploration has the following features
 - Data Wrangling

 - Univariate Data Exploration
 - Bivariate Data Exploration
 - Multivariate Data Exploration
> In the second part of the projection, I summarized key findings in a slide deck.
